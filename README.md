Handy Tip Calculator is a simple Android Application written in Java. It calculates a tip for e.g., your waiter at a restaurant, depending on what percentage of the total bill you want to give him/her. You can also divide the tip among up to 16 people. 
You can download Handy Tip Calculator from the google play store at http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=archuleta.azslr.handytipcalculator
